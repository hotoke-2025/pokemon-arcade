Pokemon Theme Song

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
I wanna be the very best  
Like no one ever was  
To catch them is my real test  
To train them is my cause  

00:12.001 --> 00:24.000
I will travel across the land  
Searching far and wide  
Teach Pokémon to understand  
The power that's inside  

00:24.001 --> 00:36.000
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all), it's you and me  
I know it's my destiny  

00:36.001 --> 00:48.000
Pokémon! Oh, you're my best friend  
In a world we must defend  

00:48.001 --> 01:00.000
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all), a heart so true  
Our courage will pull us through  

01:00.001 --> 01:12.000
You teach me, and I'll teach you  
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all!)  

01:12.001 --> 01:24.000
Gotta catch 'em all! Pokémon! Yeah!  

01:24.001 --> 01:36.000
Every challenge along the way  
With courage I will face  
I will battle every day  
To claim my rightful place  

01:36.001 --> 01:48.000
Come with me, the time is right  
There's no better team  
Arm in arm, we'll win the fight  
It's always been our dream  

01:48.001 --> 02:00.000
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all), it's you and me  
I know it's my destiny  

02:00.001 --> 02:12.000
Pokémon! Oh, you're my best friend  
In a world we must defend  

02:12.001 --> 02:24.000
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all), a heart so true  
Our courage will pull us through  

02:24.001 --> 02:36.000
You teach me, and I'll teach you  
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all!)  

02:36.001 --> 02:48.000
Gotta catch 'em all! Gotta catch 'em all!  
Gotta catch 'em all!  

02:48.001 --> 03:00.000
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all), it's you and me  
I know it's my destiny  

03:00.001 --> 03:12.000
Pokémon! Oh, you're my best friend  
In a world we must defend  

03:12.001 --> 03:21.000
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all), a heart so true  
Our courage will pull us through  
You teach me, and I'll teach you
